Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. 


Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/500x300.png){: .align-center}
